## Abstract 

The project asks the developer to design a functionally effective, sensible, and aesthetically pleasing UX/UI hotel management tool. The user can log in as a manager or as a guest. 

The manager can: </br>
View percentage and number of rooms available, today's total revenue. </br>
View guests' names, a list of all of their bookings, and the total amount theyâ€™ve spent </br>
Add a room booking for that user </br>
Delete any upcoming room bookings for that user (they cannot delete a booking from the past)

The guest can:</br>
Select date to book a room </br>
Upon selecting a date, user should be shown a list of room details for only rooms that are available on that date </br>
Filter the list of available rooms by their roomType property </br>
Select a room for booking </br>
View an apology notice and prompt to select new date in the event rooms are unavailable on chosen date </br>
View any room bookings (past or present) </br>
The total amount they have spent on rooms </br>
